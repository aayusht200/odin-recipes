        <h2>What is Chole?</h2>
        <p>
            Chole refers to an Indian chickpeas curry, especially popular in northern
            parts of India. Chole is made with soaking chickpeas (also known as
            garbanzo beans) overnight and then cooking them with onions, tomatoes and
            spices to make this really flavorful curry. There are many ways in which
            you can make chole, and there’s no really right or wrong way of making
            them. Some people make chole without tomatoes, some make them without
            onions. Some people use basic spices in their chole while others use
            “chole masala” which is a special blend of spices. No two houses in India
            will probably have the same recipe for chole. I know they were made
            differently in my house compared to how they were made in my husband’s
            house. But the base of the dish remains the same.
